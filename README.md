 ### A Food Ordering Website


This is a user-friendly food delivery website that allows the user to browse through a wide range of food options from several restaurants, including various cuisines and desserts and choose the food items they would like to have delivered to the comforts of their homes. 
The website allows the user to add as many items as they want, saves this data, and then produces the total bill. It also asks for the contact information of the user using an HTML form and saves this data onto the database for future references.
